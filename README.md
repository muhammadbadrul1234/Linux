# Linux

The Linux Commands Handbook follows the 80/20
rule: learn in 20% of the time the 80% of a topic.
I find this approach gives a well-rounded overview.
This book does not try to cover everything under the
sun related to Linux and its commands. It focuses on
the small core commands that you will use the 80% or
90% of the time, trying to simplify the usage of the
more complex ones.
All those commands work on Linux, macOS, WSL,
and anywhere you have a UNIX environment.
I hope the contents of this book will help you achieve
what you want: get comfortable with Linux.
